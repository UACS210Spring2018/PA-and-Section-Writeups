# Programming Assignment (PA) Creation

This will create a key that after being scraped out can be copied 
into a repository that github will use to start each of the student 
assignments.  Want to do a separate one for each assignment and 
section so the eclipse project name is different per assignment.  
These instructor/TA instructions require using the command line, 
but the students should not have to use the command line.

1. Create a sub-directory here (e.g. PA1-Gradenator/)

2. Create a README.md file in that subdirectory.  It will be the
assignment writeup.  Can always copy from a previous assignment to
get started.

3. Add all created files to this git repository.
