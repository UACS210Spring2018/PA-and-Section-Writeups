-----------------------
INITIAL SETUP

	(1) In github, create your own fork (i.e. copy) of the repository.  This fork lives in your github account.

	(2) On your machine get a clone of your fork.
		git init
		git clone <URL you can copy from github page for your fork>

	(3) Understand what your fork on github is called and what the CS210Spring2018 repository in UACS210Spring2018 is called.
		cd CS210Spring2018
		git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/githubusername/CS210Spring2018.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/githubusername/CS210Spring2018.git (push)
		
		git remote add upstream https://github.com/UACS210Spring2018/CS210Spring2018.git
		git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/githubusername/CS210Spring2018.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/githubusername/CS210Spring2018.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/UACS210Spring2018/CS210Spring2018.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/UACS210Spring2018/CS210Spring2018.git (push)

-----------------------
COMMITTING and PUSHING CHANGES

	git add filename		// adds a file to next commit
	git commit			// locally commits changes on files that have been added, provide a useful log message
	git push				// pushes the changes to your fork on github (i.e. origin)


-----------------------
GETTING YOUR CHANGES INCORPORATED INTO SHARED REPOSITORY (i.e. upstream)

	on github open the webpage for your fork

	click new pull request

	create a pull request by following the web forms

	if MMS doesnâ€™t notice it soon enough, then ping her in email

-----------------------
UPDATING YOUR FORK WITH NEWEST SHARED REPOSITORY

	Before you make a new pull request and once your pull request has been accepted

	in your local working directory
	git fetch upstream
	git checkout master
	git rebase upstream/master			// If you get stuck here call MMS or Mahdi for help.
	git push -f origin master
