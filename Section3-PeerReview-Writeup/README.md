## Introduction 
The goal of today's section is to introduce you to Aropa, our peer review tool,
and write your first two peer reviews. 

## Setup 
You will need to go to the Aropa website, click on the U of A logo or select
the University of Arizona on the dropdown menu and then log in using your UA
netid and the class code 386198. The website is linked below and the same 
instructions are posted on Piazza.

You will be prompted to change your password. Choose a secure password that 
you will remember as we will use these same accounts for peer reviews in 
the future. 

## The Assignment
Overview : Setup your Aropa account and write two peer reviews for PA2. 

### Step One
You will need to upload your PA2main.java file first. If you do not have
access to your PA2main from the computer you are on, remember that you 
can download this file through your Gradescope account. 

Will add more instructions once I am able to edit the assignment and make
it live as an instructor.
