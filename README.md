## General Course Organization
* Lectures: Most likely, usage of electronic devices will not be allowed in lecture.  This will also apply to all of you.

* Sections: Google docs for section notes and instructions and Github for example and starter code.  (These will be the focus of the weekly prep meeting.)

* Drills: CloudCoder will be used, (Problems will need to be tested by you all before we give them to students)

* Programming Assignments (PAs): Github classroom will be used in coordination with Eclipse.  The 210 students will NOT need (or be taught) ANY command-line.  Travis CI will be used to ensure that student projects compile and run on public test cases with the grading scripts. (PAs will need proof read and done by you all before being given to students.)

* Grading PAs for code decomposition and style: Investigating 3 possible options for this.

* Quizzes and Exams: Gradescope.  There will be a quiz every Monday in class over assigned reading material.  We will be scanning them in and using the Gradescope online SW. (Should be doing a demo quiz during the TA orientation for CS 210.)

* Peer Reviews: Still working on this but probably Aropa.

* Grades: D2L for students to access, Google sheet copies for TAs?

* Reading assignments: Will be posted on Piazza.  Pulling from various sources.

* Web page, syllabus, and discussion forum: piazza, https://piazza.com/arizona/spring2018/csc210/home

* Slack to communicate amongst TAs: cs210spring2018ua.slack.com
